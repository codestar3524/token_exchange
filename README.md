# Implementation Guide for Payrius Exchange Updates

This guide explains how to implement the menu button functionality, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages, and fix the QR code scanner functionality.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have these packages installed:

```bash
npm install react-qr-scanner
```

## 1. Component Structure

Create or update the following files in your project structure:

- `components/LeftMenu.jsx` - Updated with working menu button
- `components/ExchangeForm.jsx` - Updated with working QR scanner
- `components/QRCodeScanner.jsx` - New component for QR scanning
- `pages/terms-of-service.js` - New page for Terms of Service
- `pages/privacy-policy.js` - New page for Privacy Policy
- `pages/contact.js` - New page for Contact
- `components/pages/TermsOfService.jsx` - Component for Terms of Service content
- `components/pages/PrivacyPolicy.jsx` - Component for Privacy Policy content

## 2. Update the Menu Button

Replace your current `LeftMenu.jsx` with the new implementation that includes proper state management for opening/closing the menu.

## 3. Terms and Privacy Pages

1. Create the new page files in the `pages` directory
2. Create the content components in the `components/pages` directory
3. Add the provided CSS for styling these pages

## 4. Fix the QR Code Scanner

1. Create the new `QRCodeScanner.jsx` component
2. Update `ExchangeForm.jsx` to use the new scanner component
3. Add the provided CSS for the QR scanner styling

## 5. Add the Styles

Add both the content page styles and QR scanner styles to your CSS files. You can either:

1. Add them to your global CSS file
2. Create separate CSS modules for each
3. Use styled-components or another CSS-in-JS solution

## 6. Testing

Test the implementation to ensure:

1. The menu button opens and closes properly
2. The menu links navigate to the correct pages
3. The QR code scanner opens and works correctly
4. The Terms and Privacy pages display correctly

## 7. Browser Compatibility Notes

- The QR code scanner requires camera access, which only works in secure contexts (HTTPS)
- Clipboard access for the paste button may require user permission on some browsers
- Ensure proper error handling for browsers that don't support these features

## 8. Troubleshooting

If the QR scanner doesn't work:
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure camera permissions are granted
- Try using a different QR code library if needed (alternatives: html5-qrcode, jsQR)

If the menu doesn't work:
- Check for CSS conflicts
- Ensure the state is being properly managed
- Check for any JavaScript errors in the console
